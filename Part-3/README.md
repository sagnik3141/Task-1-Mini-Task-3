## Motors
The original solution makes use of DC motors. I think stepper motors would be a better option.
### Pros
* Precise movement control
* Mounting is easier
### Cons
* Not very powerful as compared to DC motors but for the current application, it works well.
* Complex control requirements, but it can be overcome by a stepper motor controller.
