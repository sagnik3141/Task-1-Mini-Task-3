# Glowing Ring
## Problem Statement
Make a ring that glows when a person wears it.
## Mechanism for Detection
The main objective of this project is to make it as small as possible. **A Darlington Circuit** can act as a touch sensor.

A Darlington circuit is simple in connections, yet it has excellent features.

A Darlington transistor pair comprises of a couple of bipolar transistors that are coupled in order to deliver a very high-current gain from a low-base current. In this transistor, the emitter of the input transistor is connected to the base terminal of the output transistor, base and collectors of these transistors are wired together. Therefore, the current that is amplified by the first transistor then by the second transistor.

The very weak current passing through your body can turn on an LED.
## Power Supply
As it is a ring and we cannot afford to use anything that takes up a lot of space, two 1.5V button cells is appropriate for this project.
