* The main objective of this project is to make it as small as possible. **A Darlington Circuit** can act as a touch sensor.
* A Darlington circuit is simple in connections, yet it has excellent features.
* 
The very weak current passing through your body can turn on an LED.
## Power Supply
As it is a ring and we cannot afford to use anything that takes up a lot of space, two 1.5V button cells is appropriate for this project.
